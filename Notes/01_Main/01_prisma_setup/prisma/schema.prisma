// This is your Prisma schema file,
// learn more about it in the docs: https://pris.ly/d/prisma-schema

generator client {
  // generator is where you code is generated into
  // so this file is a schema file
  // so we will going to define code related to database into prisma format
  // and when we will run the generator what are we goingto generate a code into son in this case we are generating this prisma-client-js
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  // but if we are creating a graphQL api there is a different generator we can use that can generate graphQL api code for you automatically according to schema
  // but for now we will use default generator
}

datasource db {
  // datasource is the database that we are using for this project
  provider = "postgresql"
  // here provide is prostgresql
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
  // and the user is defined inside .env file
}

// so now we will going to define the schema
model User {
  // User is the model 
  // and in prisma inside model it should contain id

  id   Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  // here we are defining id with integer and default value is autoincrement 
  name String
}
